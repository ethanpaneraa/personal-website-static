    <section id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a first-generation low-income (FGLI) second-year Computer Science student at Northwestern University. My current interests span full-stack development, artificial intelligence, and the intersection between technology and art. Minus the jargon, I am motivated by the idea and desire to empower folks with high-quality and accessible and user experiences. My ultimate goal and desire with technology is to be able to create technology that can empower entire communities.
      <br>
      <br>
          At Northwestern, you can find me working at the research group Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching (tiilt), a research lab focused on the intersectionality between technology and education. At tiilt lab, I work with the B.L.I.N.C project, a project that utilizes multimodal learning analytics to give educators real-time quantitative data on student discussions. With the project, I help out with leading and conduct user testing. 
        <br>
        <br>

      I am also involved with organizations such as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) as well as EmergingCoders, an organization focused on providing first-generation and low-income aspiring technologist opportunities to develop technical skills and learn more about the technology industry.
