## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the user‚Äôs experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?

   If I had more time to incorporate more features into my website, I would add another section displaying my technical skills and past professional experiences. It would improve the user experience in such a way that it would give them more information about me and would better allow me to structure and organize my "about me" section. Some of the challenges I anticipate when trying to implement this feature is going to be having to organize and layout these elements on the page in such a way that it's readable and accessible for readers. Also having to consider the styling so that my webpage doesn't have a large wall of text.

  I would also like to add more accessibility features such as a high contrast mode as well as a feature that could magnify text for visually-impaired users since some of my text could be hard to read. This would improve the overall accessibility of my website as well as more components for different users to be able to use and interact with my website. Some of the challenges I think could come up with this could be how the magnifying feature could be making sure that it accurately displays the magnified portions of the website correctly and in such a way that is not disrupted or makes the website pixelated/hard to read. A high contrast could pose a problem with organization and placement. Currently I have a button for switching for the color view of the webpage and it could add more clutter to the nav bar if I were to add another button. So organization could be a place of concern with adding that feature. 


* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?

  I think that web accessibility is important because it makes sure that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can access and use the internet to its fullest extent and purpose. When websites are inaccessible, that creates a significant barrier of entry and use for folks that have disabilities. This can ultimately hinder and limit folks' ability to obtain the information they need, engage and interact with others virtually, and participate in the online world. When we design and develop websites with accessibility in mind and at the forefront of our design, software engineers and developers can create an online environment that is more inclusive and accommodates the needs of folks with disabilities. This benefits everyone as well since these features need to enhance user experiences which leads to greater engagement and better outcomes for everyone! 

  I chose to implement the accessibility features that I did because I felt as though they were the most common accessibility features that I see and interact with on a daily basis such as the toggle between light and dark mode. I also wanted to create distinct sections for each part of my website because as I was creating, I noticed there was minimal distinction between all of the different sections and wanted to create something to emphasize the beginning and start of a component. I also wanted to add alt text to my images in case my user was struggling to load up the images on my site or wasn't able to view them physically. That way, they could still have a solid idea of what my website entails. I also chose color-scents that complement each other so that when users are reading my text, it is not visually straining as well as choosing a font that is focused on readability.
